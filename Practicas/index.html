      <span>
        Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your
        use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for
        streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and
        software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms
        (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts,
        audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify
        Service ("Content").
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy Policy and
        additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are
        made part of these Terms by this reference.</span
      >
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to
        these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use
        the Spotify Service or access any Content.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER
        SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY
        OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION
        THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
        <strong>Service provider</strong>
        <br />
        These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc., 4 World Trade Center,
        150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        <strong>Age and eligibility requirements</strong>
        <br />
        BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER
        TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR
        OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE
        TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any
        Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any
        registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true,
        accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.

      <span>
        <strong>Spotify Service options</strong>
        <br/>
        We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        <strong>Trials</strong>
        <br/>
        From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        <strong>Third-party applications, devices and open source software</strong>
        <br/>
        The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        <strong>Service limitations and modifications</strong>
        <br/>
        We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        <ul>
            <li>The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings).</li>
            <li>Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</li>
        </ul>
      </span>
      <br/>
            <span>
        If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.
      </span>
       <br/>
       <br/>
      <span>
        Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.
